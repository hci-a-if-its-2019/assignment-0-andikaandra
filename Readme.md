### IEFAIR 
[ie-games.iefairits.com](http://ie-games.iefairits.com) is a login page from main website [ie-games](https://www.iefairits.com/) created for the needs of publication of events from one of the departments at ITS, the main page is clearly fine, but i think the developers need to fix about the register form
<br> ![register-page](assets/img/1549980550323.jpg) <br>
at the first sight the page looks fine, but the fatal mistakes is when i submitted the form (register), MY ACCOUNT SUCCESSFULLY CREATED :disappointed_relieved: . the captcha code that i wrote is wrong but the form is successfully passed.
<br><br>
after my account created, and redirected to my dashboard, i tried to check forgot password page, lets check the picture below
<br> ![forgot-page](assets/img/1549980850738.jpg) <br>
maybe this is the simple thing, but the page dont have "the link" to go back to homepage or previous page. so user manually to go to homepage.
